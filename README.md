# FantasyFlight-Warhammer-games-Pointbuy-characteristic-tracker
Made almost entirely by the AI of chatGPT, all-in-one html page with CSS and Javascript, my IT teacher would kill me if he saw all this. Based primarily off the Deathwatch pointbuy system, but should be compatible with any FantasyFlight warhammer games.
This lets you have a set amount of points to use to increase characteristics, which are kept track of separately from the modifiers you can apply to them. Toughness bonus and strength bonus are shown but cannot be modified with points, they're the decimal value of the relevant stat; you can add modifiers to them though, if the system uses Unnatural Characteristics, permanent Power Armor, etc. Otherwise, it's just for easier stat spread checking. 

Notes: By pressing CTRL whilst pressing the + or - button of a characteristic you reduce or increase it by 10 as long as that fits within the available points. If something doesn't update instantly then modify a characteristic to re-render the character sheet.
